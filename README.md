## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2treesan/FIRE
cd FIRE
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the main script with your configurations:

```bash
python main.py \
    loader.hr_dir="<path_to_hr>" \
    model="<model_name>" \
    trainer.epochs=100 \
    # Add other configurations as needed
```

- Replace `<path_to_hr>` with the path to your high-resolution images.
- Replace `<model_name>` with the model defined in the `src/model` directory.

## Available Models

- **EDSRLite**: A lightweight version of the Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution network, optimized for faster performance while maintaining high-quality results.
